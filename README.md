#PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

The project deals on building an application which helps the specially challenged people to communicate between them and the common people. Communication between a person with hearing/speech impairment and a normal person has always been a challenging task. This application tries to reduce the barrier of communication by developing an assistive application for specially challenged people.
